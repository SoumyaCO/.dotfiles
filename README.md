### Programs

1. [Neovim](nvim/.config/nvim) - from "kickstart.nvim" customized for backend dev.
2. [Aerospace](aerospace/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml) - i3 like window management in macos
3. [yazi](yazi/.config/yazi) - file navigator (for now it's default)
4. [wezterm](wezterm/.config/wezterm) - simple wezterm terminal config with lua
5. [tmux](tmux/.tmux.conf) - easy keymaps, nice theme with "tpm"
6. [zsh](zsh/.zshrc) - lots of aliases for easy nav.

> **NOTE**: *It's for mac, some of the configs like zsh(homebrew), and aerospace may not work on linux*
